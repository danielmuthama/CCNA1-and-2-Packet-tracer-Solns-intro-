Part 1: Verify the Default Switch Configuration
===============================================

enable 		#to enter privileged EXEC mode
sh running-config	#To display the running configuration

*How many Fast Ethernet interfaces does the switch have?
24.FastEthernet0/1 to FastEthernet0/24.

*How many Gigabit Ethernet interfaces does the switch have?
2. GigabitEthernet0/1 and GigabitEthernet0/2.

What is the range of values shown for the vty lines?
0-15

*Which command will display the current contents of non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM)?
show startup-config

*Why does the switch respond with “startup-config is not present?”
Because there is no saved configuration , we can do that with the command " coppy running-config startup-config".

Part 2: Create a Basic Switch Configuration
===========================================

configure terminal		#To enter configuration mode
hostname S1			#To configure the switch name
exit 				#To go back to privileged EXEC mode

configure terminal		#To enter configuration mode
line console 0			#To identify the line for configuration
password letmein		#To set the password for line console 0
login				#To enable login
exit				#To go back to configuration mode
exit				#To go back to privileged EXEC mode
exit 				#To exit privileged EXEC mode
exit 				#To log out the switch

<enter>			#To re-enter the switch, you will be asked for the line con 0 password : letmein

enable 			#to enter privileged EXEC mode
configure terminal		#To enter configuration mode
enable password c1$c0		#To set a password to protect access to privileged mode
exit				#To go back to privileged EXEC mode

*Step 5
exit 				#To log out the switch
<enter>			#To re-enter the switch, you will be asked for the line con 0 password : letmein

enable 			#to enter privileged EXEC mode,you will be asked for the password : c1$c0
show running-config		#To display the running configuration. You will see the passwords in plain text.

*Step 6
conf t				#To enter configuration mode. Short for "configure terminal"
enable secret itsasecret	#To configure an encrypted password for secure access to privileged mode
exit				#To exit configuration mode

*Step 7
sh run				#To display the running configuration.Short for "show running-config"

*Step 8
conf t				#To enter configuration mode. Short for "configure terminal"
service password-encryption	#To encrypt plain text passwords
exit 				#To exit configuration mode

Part 3: Configure a MOTD Banner
===============================
conf t				#To enter configuration mode. Short for "configure terminal"
banner motd "This ... Only!"	#To configure a warning message that displays when an user tries to log in
exit				#To exit configuration mode

Part 4: Save and Verify Configuration Files to NVRAM
====================================================
copy running-config startup-config # To back up the running configuration file to NVRAM 

*What is the shortest, abbreviated version of the copy running-config startup-config command?
cop ru st

*Which command will display the contents of NVRAM?
sh startup-config

Part 5: Configure S2
====================
en				#to enter privileged EXEC mode.Short for "enable"
conf t				#To enter configuration mode.Short for "configure terminal"
hostname S2			#To configure the switch name.

line console 0			#To identify the line for configuration
password letmein		#To set the password for line console 0
login				#To enable login
exit				#To go back to configuration mode

enable password c1$c0		#To set a password to protect access to privileged mode

enable secret itsasecret	#To configure an encrypted password.

banner motd "This ... Only!"	#To configure an appropriate message motd

service password-encryption	#To encrypt plain text passwords

sh run				#To ensure that the configuration is correct.

copy running-config startup-config #To back up the running configuration file to NVRAM
